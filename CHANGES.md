## Changes in 0.2.0

* Switched to [xcube-resampling](https://xcube-dev.github.io/xcube-resampling/) 
  for dataset resampling and reprojection.  
* Renamed the keyword argument `spline_orders` to `interp_methods` to align with 
  the naming convention used in xcube-resampling.  
* Fixed issue #39: resolved `AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'coords'`.


## Changes in 0.1.1

* Fixed a bug in Sentinel-2 cube generation where, during mosaicking of adjacent tiles 
  from the same solar day, data from one spectral band would overwrite all other bands 
  in the final cube.


## Changes in 0.1.0

* Implemented workflows for generating 3D data cubes from multiple Sentinel-2 tiles.
  This includes spatial mosaicking of adjacent tiles and temporal stacking of
  multiple observations.

## Changes in 0.0.1

* Initial package structure.
* Basic README and documentation.
* License and contribution guidelines.
